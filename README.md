# DES228_ProjectTwo

 by Yasmine Nekkab

## Project Overview

I will be utilizing the first portion of the song "Somewhere I Belong" by Linkin Park to express my interpretation of community.

I chose this song in particular because it articulates how I view community from a position of being quite lonely. When you are depressed you can feel like people couldn't understand or relate to how you feel. This song is about longing for a community that understands you and being surprised that you are actually not alone at all. 

## Technical Overview

The design is inspired by Linkin Park's punk style.

The words will be emphasized and reiterated through transformations, colors, and other aspects through CSS.

The code is all done through Visual Studio Code and hosted by GitHub.
